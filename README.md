# SocketTetris

It is my final project of Operating System course when I was in my sophomore year. I found that it is always interesting to look back to your old codes to see the improvement of your programming skills and coding style. 

Anyway, this is a project based on existing tetris project (vitetris), by modifing some codes and implement socket stuff, we allow it to play through internet. (Actually, I forget the details haha...)
